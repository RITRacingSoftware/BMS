This is the matlab autgenerated code for the SIM.
The main files are:
LogicalAccumulator.h
ert_main.c

Anything else is not relevant to what we are doing.

LogicalAccumulator.h contains all the datatype definitions. Lines 142-152 are the structs for inputs and outputs. Lines 170 and 173 are the instaniations of those structs.
Those variables are what the simulation uses as it inputs. Lines 176 and 177 are the two functions needed to run the simulation. 

ert_main.c is the autogenerated file that will run the simulation. We don't want to use this, instead you should make you're own C program that calls the functions in
LogicalAccumulator.h to run the simulation
